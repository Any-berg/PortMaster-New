Hellos, I am one of the Devâ€™s from PortMaster and we work to bring games from PC to arm linux based handhelds. I have managed to get the steam copy to work and am wondering if you would allow the distribution of your game via PortMaster or would you prefer users to download your game from Steam/itch.io? Awesome game btw!

Thank you! PortMaster seems like a wonderful resource. I would be honored to have the game distributed through PortMaster as long as credit is given. In my opinion, the more people who can find The Rush, the better!
