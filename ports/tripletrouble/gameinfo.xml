    <desc>"Triple Trouble" is a short pixel-art point &amp; click adventure. It's the fifth installment of our running series featuring Ines and her uncle Lee. As usual it can be enjoyed as a standalone game, and this time with 78% more pixels!

You play as aspiring writer Ines, on the day of her 20th birthday. Uncle Lee had the most amazing idea for a birthday present, which can only mean trouble. As if it wasn't enough, he just triplicated himselfâ€”it can only mean TRIPLE TROUBLE.</desc>
