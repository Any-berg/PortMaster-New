Sandman.
Commonly known as the guy who makes us dream.
When he has won the lottery, he gives us wet dreams of lust and pleasure,
and if he hasn't gotten laid for a while, he gives us nightmares.
When he's on a bad LSD trip, he makes us dream the most psychic 
Twin Peaks/ X-files/ Ricky Lake/ Scooby Doo crossover murder mysteries, 
often resulting in childhood trauma for the majority of us.
But sometimes, Sandman just isn't there.

Sandman has been gone for a long while now.
Noone really knows when he left, but at one point he did, leaving us 
without lust, without nightmares, without Scooby Doo. At first none of 
us noticed, because it's not always that we remember from last nights slumber,
It was empty, but then, the visions showed up.
Now nobody has slept for god knows how long, living in constant fear of even yawning, 
fear of the terrors that has taken Sandmans place.
All of us have seen the visions at one point or another. Visions from a different 
world, a world of terror, evil, and vileness, a world where the creations from the 
nightmares are all gathered up, waiting for a soul to suck dry of fear. 
Those who's not strong enough to wake up in time are reduced to just a breathing 
shell of a human, nothing left to fill it but the occasional twitch here and there, 
perhaps the last piece of mind trying to flee from whatever's haunting it.

Some believe it is a sign of the endtimes, some believe it is aliens, and 
some just refuse to believe it. Those usually snap quite soon anyway.
All of us know though, that it can't last for much longer. There are 
limits for both the human psyche and body, and one day those limits 
will break us, throwing perhaps the whole of humanity into coma.
But we still hope that one day, someone will have enough courage to face 
their fears, and if possible, bring us back Sandman. I myself, have endured 
long, but I don't think I can stand this any more now. I think it is time to 
sleep soon. I have seen who awaits me in my head, and I know I can't possibly 
stand up to them once more. 

Please, if you think you can do what we all have failed, at least try to save our minds. 
They're all trapped in dreamland, come find them there...

* Information *

Whoah, a lot of maps this time. Play them and enjoy them, and when you're done, you MUST email me
and tell me what you think. Please, you must. It is really dissappointing fo us mappers to see lots of people 
download our work, only to find that two or three people even give us feedback. It's even sadder that most of 
you don't even bother to read this .txt. Pearls for swine I say. (Don't take this personal as you're obviously reading this.
I mean the swine who's not reading. ;-) )

You get some custom code with this one too! Yay! Mostly bits cut'n'pasted from the Hipnotic mission pack source, and also some stuff I made myself.
(Made myself meaning copying a couple of lines of excisting code and changing a few values here and there.) The source is of course compiled
with ProQCC made by Lee Smith. ( lees@infoave.net )

Credits: Gee, who should I thank? Umm, lets start with everybody that hangs out in #terrafusion. You all make my day something 
new and refreshing. Thanks to SmallPileofGibs (SPoG) who is the oracle of all mapping and made these maps 
possible by learning me the wonderful inner workings of curves and and even Qbsp, light and Vis. Thanks to Shambler as well. 
Wouldn't know why I should thank him, but he keeps Q1SP alive, so he's great too.
Also thanks to my sister, who surprized me by showing even a slight interrest for my work. (Wow.)
Thanks to my beta testers; Than, Bal, Vondur, DaMaul, uhm... a couple of more guys that I just can't remember atm. Sorry :-/
Handshakes to the omniously named Death2Uall ( http://factory.thebackburner.com/ )who made the gothic Q3A soundpak, from which I 
have found some useful samples.
=======================================================================

* Installation *

Make a directory paralell to id1 in your quake dir and call it czg07. (Ie. C:\Games\quake\czg07\ ) Extract all files in this .zip to it.
If you are running GLQuake in windows, create a shortcut that runs quake with the following parameters: -game czg07 
(Ie. C:\games\quake\glquake.exe -game czg07) All your other parameters may also be added here, like -heapsize and all that jazz.

NOTE: You need a lot of RAM to run this level smoothly. You can make Quake use more RAM by adding
-winmem xx to your DOSQuake command line, or -heapsize xx000 to your GLQuake command line.
Substitute xx with the amount of RAM that you want to use. I use -heapsize 56000 and get perfect performance.

NOTE: With the release of the Quake source code, a lot of new versions of GLQuake are pouring out.
If possible, use one that disables that awful waterwarp "feature". Like DarkPlaces. (Plug for LordHavoc.)

If you're playing GLQuake, (which I higly recommend you to do,) use r_wateralpha 1 , r_shadows 0 and gl_flashblend 0 and a 
very high GL_subdivide_size. (like 1024. The higher the setting, the better the performance, but the sky looses quite a lot
of visual quality. Anything below 128 is suicide.) All of these are ofcourse set in the console.
NOTE: There is an autexec.cfg included, to set these variables for you and load up the start map on startup (Running the standard demos before loading the 
start map may cause those nasty GL_Cache_mismatch errors) and thus if you are running software quake, you'll get some errors of the type 
"Unrecognized command r_wateralpha" and so on. Just ignore these, as you won't suffer any of the pains of the GL wickedness.
