    <desc>Super Hexagon is a fast-paced, minimalistic arcade game where you control a tiny triangle orbiting a central hexagon, dodging an onslaught of spinning walls. With intense music, rapid movement, and a constantly shifting geometric world, it’s a game of pure reflexes and precision. It’s tough, addictive, and will have you saying, “just one more try” way too many times.</desc>
