## Notes

      This game asks what way you want to have the input work at the very beginning. I suggest using "Gamepad Only" as this port uses SDL and will work best with that option,
     Please be aware, this game runs slowly on RK3326 Devices. It is still playable, but is much better of an experience on H700/RK3566 Devices.
   Thank You to Linky439 for assisting with getting this to run correctly on PortMaster! He was so awesome to work with and he was very happy to help!
Also, Thank You to Ganimoth for pointing out a few tips during the process.
