For entering text (for names, etc.) --

1. Enter text-input mode using: `START + DPAD-DOWN`
2. Once activated, use `DPAD-UP/DOWN` to select letters, and `DPAD-LEFT/RIGHT` to move a letter back/forward
3. Use `A` for `ENTER` (when you're done)

In some instances, you may need to press `START` to confirm and exit interactive text entry; `SELECT/HOTKEY` cancels interactive text entry.
