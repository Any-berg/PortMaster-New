Thanks to the [Yamagi Quake II team](https://github.com/yquake2/yquake2) for developing this client and [romadu](https://github.com/romadu/yquake2) for the porting work for portmaster.  Thanks to Habbening and Slayer366 for the port updates to support expansion packs and GLES3 support (also provided by the Yamagi Quake II team via their latest yq2 source port updates).
