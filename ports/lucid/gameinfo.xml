    <desc> LUCID is a Point &amp; Click / Top-down hybrid adventure about a young kid in a very bizarre world of odd characters and even weirder happenings.
 Use the cursor to highlight objects and characters, left click on them to interact. When the cursor displays a blue X, this means you're not close enough to the target and must move closer before interacting.</desc>
