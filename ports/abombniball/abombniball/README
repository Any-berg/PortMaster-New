Description 
===========
The objective of Abombniball is to defuse all the explosives on each level.
As a ball, this would normally be a simple task,
however each level is filled with traps and devious puzzles placed there by
...oh...lets say "Dr. Y-Front", your arch-nemesis (he's very evil).
These traps take the form of special tiles which disappear or do other nasty things.

To compile:
===========

git clone git@github.com:Cebion/Abombniball.git
cd Abombniball
./configure
make -j8
