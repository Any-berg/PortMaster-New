## Notes

Modified from source: [Slayer366](https://github.com/Slayer366/CatacombSDL-hh)

Both the floppy disk and GOG versions are compatible.

If you don't own either of the Catacomb games you can get Catacomb (1989) and The Catacomb (a.k.a. Catacomb II) from:
[GOG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/catacombs_pack)

Copy all *.CAT files into the 'ports/catacomb/' directory.

Files should be uppercase.  If game files are lowercase, the launcher will attempt to convert them to uppercase automatically.

Game files needed:
- catacomb/DEMO.CAT
- catacomb/LEVEL1.CAT thru catacomb/LEVEL10.CAT
- catacomb/SOUNDS.CAT
- catacomb/TOPSCORS.CAT
