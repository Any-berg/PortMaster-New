# Notes

Thanks to [Backterria](https://backterria.itch.io) for creating this fantastic game, which you can grab at [itch.io](https://backterria.itch.io/dead-knight)

**Notes** 

- This has been tested with `Dead Knight v0-1.exe` *(2024-10-10)*
- The game is still in development; updates will *likely* remain compatible with the port. But please report **on the PortMaster Discord** if some update stops working.
