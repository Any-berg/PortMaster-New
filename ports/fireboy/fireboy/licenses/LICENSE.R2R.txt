Great game! can't stop looking at that fire animation :D

I have a question, I ported your game as a part of the PortMaster project, which aims to to bring modern games to Linux handhelds.

Ready 2 Run ports (ones that package the game files with the port) get more love and attention, so wanted to ask if you would consider allowing us to include the game file in our PortMaster package? https://portmaster.games

Thanks! :)

ps: If you need any further explanation about any part of the porting process just ask :D
