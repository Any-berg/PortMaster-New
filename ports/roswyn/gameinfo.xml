    <desc>Roswyn and The Dragons is an exciting Action-RPG game (with direct combat). As Roswyn, your goal (you don't know exactly why, but it's not important :) ) will be to defeat the 9 dragons to save the world (once again...).

In your quest, you'll travel through 500 levels(screens) including plains, marshes, dungeons, caves, mountains and much more. You'll get more and more powerful by finding new heart-pieces, or by upgrading your sword to crush pots and rocks or even throw fireballs !!</desc>
