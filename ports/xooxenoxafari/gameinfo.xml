    <desc>It's your summer vacation on Xoo Island! This beautiful, deserted island is populated by a surreal menagerie of alien creatures. Can you find them all? While you're at it, you might as well collect a bunch of fossils, gems, eggs, merit badges, video games, and anything else that isn't nailed down. Xoo: Xeno Xafari is a new style of collecting RPG.</desc>
