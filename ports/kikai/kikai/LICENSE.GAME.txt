My name is Zehmaluco and I'm part of a group of developers working on porting games to handheld Linux devices. Our project is named PortMaster.

It would be fantastic if you could grant us permission to include your http://data.win etc.. of Kikai within our packaged port. May we distribute the game file/s in question, please? 

If you want to know more about the project here your website, portmaster.games

Thank you for your time.

@zehmaluco Go for it. My stuff's MIT licensed, don't expect any support from me and don't misrepresent who made the game, otherwise go nuts

@zehmaluco I have a lot of games with actual linux ports that might be easier to port but go with whatever ya want xD

@farawaythyer Thanks. I'm currently working on porting GameMaker so Kikay is perfect for our project. People will really dig it. :D
