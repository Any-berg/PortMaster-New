If youre looking to add dlcs to your game, the process is rather simple.

If you have the DlC on Steam (Not the game files, just the dlc):
-Both windows and linux files work
-From your game installation, take the /DLC/ folder and transfer it into /steamworldheist/ directly
-Run the game as you normally would

If you have the DLC on GOG:
-Take one DLC installer at a time and place it within /steamworldheist/installer/
-Start the game for it to install (Then repeat for the next DLC installer)
Do not try to add multiple DLC installers at once into /installer/
