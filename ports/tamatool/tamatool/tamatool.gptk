#       Pressing s puts the emulation in step by step mode and executes the next instruction, while r resumes it.
#       Pressing w fully executes the next instruction or call (no step by step inside a call).
#       Pressing x stops the execution right after the next call.
#       Pressing c stops the execution right after the next return.
#       You can press the left (select), down (execute) and right (cancel) arrow keys of your keyboard.
#       Pressing f toggles between the original speed, x10 speed and unlimited speed.
#       Pressing b saves the emulation state to a saveN.bin file, while n loads the last saved state.
#       Pressing t shows/hides the shell of the Tamagotchi.
#       Pressing i increases the size of the GUI, while d decreases it.
