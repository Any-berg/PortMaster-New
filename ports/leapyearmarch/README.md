## Notes

Special thanks to [Daniel Linssen](https://daniellinssen.games) and [Sokpop Collective](https://sokpop.itch.io) for this awesome game!

**FOR LESS POWERFUL HANDHELDS (LIKE RK3326)** rename `data.win` to `data_potato.win` before running the game. This will improve performance at the expense of graphics quality.
