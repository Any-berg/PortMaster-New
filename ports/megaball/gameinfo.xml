    <desc>The goal is to roll the ball over every flashing panel to complete the stage. For each stage you complete, you gain one extra life. If you need to, you can self-destruct (and lose a life) and shatter into ten pieces, killing any enemy which collides with these pieces; you will immediately re-spawn, and the enemy will reappear in 5 seconds.</desc>
