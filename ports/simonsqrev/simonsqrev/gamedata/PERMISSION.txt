## Notes

my request: 
Hi all! I'm new here👾 I'm a dev at PortMaster. We port numerous games to Linux devices. Please come check us out! 
 A few months back I ported the older version of this game to Linux devices via PortMaster. It requires the user to manually add their game files to the setup folder provided by PortMaster. 
  I wish to ask your permission to distribute this games files (data.win, .ogg etc..) inside a READY to RUN port. 
 May we please distribute said files, please? 
 We make no money from these ports and you are welcome to come join us and have any say you'd like in the porting of your game. Our goals are to get more and more games working and ported successfully, while showcasing incredible game devs as yourself! 🎮🕹️👾 I have your latest updated version working and have not updated the old PortMaster port just yet. It was brought to my attention that you had graced us with an updated version of this title so I felt while I was updating my setup files, I thought to myself that I'd love to take the opportunity to find you n ask permission to distribute. I feel it could draw some extra attention to this great title! You will be properly thanked and linked and recognized. 
 I truly thank you for any consideration that you may lend to my request! 
 Best regards, MadShmupper and everyone at PortMaster 🎮

			So I’m happy for you to use the game in your system. 
                      I only ask that you help promote the new version as well
