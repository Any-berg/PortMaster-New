ALL-In-One Audio pack for Exult
-------------------------------

This all-in-one audio pack for Exult features the Soundblaster SFX pack,
the Roland MT-32 SFX pack and the Digital Music pack.

The Soundblaster SFX pack was recorded and contributed by Joseph Morris.
The Roland MT-32 SFX pack and the Digital Music pack were recorded and 
contributed by Simon Quinn.


This all-in-one pack is intended to consolidate the various packs into 
a big one to make setting up Exult easier.


INSTALLATION
------------

Extract the files of exult_audio.zip into your Exult data folder: 

- on Windows the data folder is normally in the folder where you installed
  Exult to (e.g. C:\Program Files\Exult\data)

- Exult always looks in /Library/Application Support/Exult/data on OS X

- on *nix based systems /usr/local/share/exult  is used by default

Exult will now find the files automatically and you can choose the sfx
packs and enable digital music in the audio setup.
