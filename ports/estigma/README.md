## Notes
 I want to extend a super huge thank you to [Vikintor](https://vikintor.itch.io/estigmaextended) for allowing PortMaster to distribute the data.win file for ESTIGMA Extended Edition as part of a ready-to-run port. Your generosity and support mean a lot to the community, and your permission makes it easier for more people to experience gems such as ESTIGMA!

Thanks again for helping make this possible!
  Another huge thanks to those who tested this port!
