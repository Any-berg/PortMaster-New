## NOTES:

This port has been possible mainly due to the following projects:

- [Celeste-Repacker](https://github.com/JohnnyonFlame/celeste-repacker):
	- Compresses Celeste's textures to ASTC 4x4
- [CelestePatches](https://github.com/JohnnyonFlame/FNAPatches/blob/master/Celeste/CelestePatches.cs)
	- Performance tweaks, ASTC 4x4 support and FMOD Hacks to update Celeste's FMOD version.
- [FNA, an XNA4 reimplementation.](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA)
	- Open source, battle-tested multiplatform reimplementation of XNA4 Refresh.
