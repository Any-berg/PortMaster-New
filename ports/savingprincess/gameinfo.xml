All you know about your mission is:
"IF THEY GET PRINCESS, THE WAR IS LOST.
IT'S UP TO YOU."
Explore a space station crawling with rogue machines and even rival bounty hunters with the same objective as you - but with far, far different intentions!
Expand your arsenal as you collect upgrades to your trusty arm cannon and armor!
Test your might against several bosses - including a FREAKING SPACE NINJA!
