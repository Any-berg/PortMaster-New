## Notes

Big thanks to [Slash7](https://slash7.itch.io/megaman-witters-domination) for this fun Mega Man fan-creation! Thanks to each of you that helped test this port!ðŸ˜Ž

While this game has a semi-functioning button setup that is kind of random, I recommend mapping them to your personal preference. Below is my own controls configuration. Arrange your own config as you desire.
