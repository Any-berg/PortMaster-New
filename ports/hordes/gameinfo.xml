    <desc>The Hordes is a shooter in the style of classic arcade titles from the 80s, with enemies that only get harder when you power up.  Max out your power up and you'll be firing an arc of ten bullets at at time, at enemies that are worth ten times as much! Developed by Pug Fugly Games. </desc>
