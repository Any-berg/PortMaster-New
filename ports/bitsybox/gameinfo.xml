Bitsy games are little games or worlds where you can walk around and talk to people and be somewhere. Games are composed of several rooms that your avatar can walk between. As your avatar walks around your Bitsy world they may interact with sprites (people, objects etc. that you can talk to) and items. Anything non-interactive in a room is called a tile, which is used for decoration.</desc>
