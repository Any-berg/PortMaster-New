    <desc>Pingus is a free clone of the popular Lemmings game.
Your goal is to guide a horde of penguins through a world full of obstacles and penguin traps to safety. Although penguins (unlike lemmings) are rather smart, they sometimes lack the necessary overview and now rely on you to save them.</desc>
