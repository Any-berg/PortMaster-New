### Rocknix libmali

This port is not compatible with Rocknix libmali. Please use the system menus
 to switch to Panfrost.

### Screen resolution

Unfortunately, the game runs in a small window on devices with 720x720 and 1024x768 resolution. Also, text is small on small displays.

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to [Lucas Pope](https://dukope.com) and [3909 LLC](https://3909.co) for the iconic and thought provoking game.

Thanks to ptitSeb for [box64](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64) and binarycounter for [Westonpack](https://github.com/binarycounter/Westonpack/wiki) and his steamstub library, without all of which this port would not be possible.

### Note re Steamstub

Steamstub is not an actual steam emulator. It does not break, bypass or circumvent any DRM or license checks. The game does not perform license checks in the first place. If the game actually checked for licenses or app ownership the game would simply crash and exit because the necessary functions are not defined here. See `steamstub/readme.txt` for more information and the source code.
