# Notes

This port includes version 3.02 of the game. It can be updated by replacing the jar file in the port directory. Please report back if future versions of the game work, so i can update the port accordingly.

A big thank you to 00-Evan/ShatteredPixel for releasing [Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/shattered-pixel-dungeon) under the GPL-3.0 license and making it available for free. Please [support the developer](https://patreon.com/ShatteredPixel) if you enjoy this game.

This port uses the new Westonpack runtime and libcrusty to provide X11 compatibility on devices that do not support X11. The runtime is still in active development and somewhat experimental. If you are experiencing issues, please reach out to me on the PM discord server, so i can improve this runtime. Thanks!
