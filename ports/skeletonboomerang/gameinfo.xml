    <desc>Skeleton Boomerang is a platformer where the hero, Hunter, must use an enchanted boomerang to put an end to an army of bony soldiers led by the voodoo master Mr. Saturday. Get high scores, collect upgrades, find secrets, and overcome many skeletal challenges!

As you progress through the game, your total score can unlock new boomerangs, new abilities, and health boosts. Your score is tied to performing combos by defeating multiple enemies in a single throw of your boomerang. The world is also full of secrets. Finding hidden items can unlock new stages and bosses.</desc>
