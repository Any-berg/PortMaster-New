## Notes

Thanks to [ReflectionHLE](https://github.com/ReflectionHLE/ReflectionHLE) for this capable source port covering the Catacomb 3D games with incredible support for mobile devices.

When using the on-screen quick-controls the buttons are swapped.  A is B, B is A, X is Y, Y is X.  This is an issue in the code as this also occurs on the Windows release, too.
