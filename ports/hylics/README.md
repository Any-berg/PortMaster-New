## Notes

**Special thanks to ...**
* ***Mason Lindroth*** - The man behind Hylics, a fun and unique game made with clay
* *mkxp-z* - A nice fork of mkxp, making porting RPG Maker VX Ace games pretty straightforward
* *marco-calautti* - For the Delta Patcher software, patches were needed in order to wrap around Win32API.
* *Jeod* - I used EmulationStation-ImageMaker for the cover, very useful script
* And of course the *PortMaster community* for its support and making this possible in the first place.
