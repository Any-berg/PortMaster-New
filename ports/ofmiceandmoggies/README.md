## Notes

Thanks to [Bippinbits](https://bippinbits.com) for creating this great game and which you can purchase in [itch.io](https://bippinbits.itch.io/of-mice-and-moggies)

Requires the Windows version: `Of Mice and Moggies.zip` -- *Sep 14, 2021*

Note that Community Level downloads are functional. But the (level) Editor requires a mouse (and there's no cursor either) -- instead, you can create levels on your PC and copy them over.
