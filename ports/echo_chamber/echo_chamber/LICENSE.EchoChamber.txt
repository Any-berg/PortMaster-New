Hey,

thank you for the fast reply!
I tested Echo Chamber and it worked great. But I'm sure your other games would work
perfectly as well.

Only need your blessing that I can include the .pck in my Portmaster package  =)
Else people would need to manually download it from itch and put it in manually.

Hi Daniel,

Sure! What games are you interested in and do you need anything from my end?

Hi Jon,

my name is Daniel and I'm one of the team members of the PortMaster Project.

We make various games and ports runable on small linux handhelds and share them with the community.
Recently we've been also adding some Godot games and I'd love to include your games as well.

I've seen various homebrew sites just distributing files but I'd rather ask for permission of the author if its okay for them.

Would be awesome to have your permission.
Your games would make a great addition on these small handhelds.

Thanks in advance! 

Daniel
