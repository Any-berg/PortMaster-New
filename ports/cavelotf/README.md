## Notes

 If you are on Rocknix, This game will work ONLY on the Panfrost GPU. You can switch between Libmali and Panfrost by pressing Start on the main page of Emulation Station, then System Settings, and then Driver. You will need to re-boot for your changes to take effect.
 This game uses a mouse. To switch items around, Hold click(R1) down as you move things and release when you want to place them.
Thank You so much to BitBrain for creating this relaxing game! Check out the game and his other work here: https://bitbrain.itch.io/cave/devlog/302573/legend-of-the-forge-update-v01
Special Thanks to Ganimoth for help with getting the mouse cursor applied in this port and to Binary Counter for creating it!
