## Notes

Copy your Shovel Knight Treasure Trove for Linux folder to the ports/shovelknight/gamedata folder.  You should have ports/shovelknight/gamedata/shovelknight folder structure with additional subfolders such as 32, 64, and data within ports/shovelknight/gamedata/shovelknight.  Once done, just run Shovel Knight.sh.

If you're running steam on windows, you can press Win+R, run `steam://open/console` then type `download_depot 250760 250764`. When it is finished downloading, steam will tell you where the files are located.
