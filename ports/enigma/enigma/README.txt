Enigma

Enigma is a unique puzzle game, with influences from almost every game
genre.  Your objective is easily explained: you control a small black
marble with your mouse and have to find and uncover all pairs of
identical Oxyd stones in each landscape.  Simple? Yes.  Easy? It would
be, if it weren't for hidden traps, vast mazes, insurmountable
obstacles and innumerable puzzles blocking your direct way to the Oxyd
stones... If you like puzzle games and have a steady hand, Enigma's
more than 1000 original levels will probably keep you busy for hours
on end.

Enigma is developed by a small group of volunteers, and help is always
appreciated.  If you like Enigma and want to contribute to its future,
