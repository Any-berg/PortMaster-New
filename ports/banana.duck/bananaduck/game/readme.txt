If you see this, then you probably has supported me or itch.io (cyfo.itch.io) or you 
have somehow got the source code, which is ok. Here I will guide you on what's allowed,
not allowed, how to use the code, etc.

The code may not be tidy, clear, or well suited for any particular use since the game was made for a gamejam.
You get to see the source code as a bonus for supporting me, and not that you bought the source code.

HOW TO EDIT THE GAME
- The easiest way to edit and run the game is to use Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) and setup the right plugins. Here is the tutorial I followed (https://www.sheepolution.com/learn/book/bonus/vscode).
- The entry point is the main.lua file.
- All game logic are under /res/objects/
- Sprites are under /res/sprite/
- Levels are in /res/ldtk/game.ldtk file, open using LDtk level edit.
