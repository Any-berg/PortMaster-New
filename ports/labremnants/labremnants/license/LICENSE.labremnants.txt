Hello, I should have contacted you earlier but I am one of the devs from PortMaster (http://portmaster.games) and I have managed to port one of your games Lab Remnants to these arm-based linux handheld device.

In order to get it working, I had to patch out the steam achievements. Users will still have to purchase the game from steam. Portmaster provides a compatability layer for the games to run and patches to prevent crashes and improve performance.

Are you okay with Lab Remnants being on PortMaster? Or would you prefer it being removed?
