    <desc>The year is 2240, you and your crew are currently on the way home from a survey mission to the Proxima Centauri system. Your science officers found some organic material on one of the planets and you are now tasked with returning those samples to Sol. Something seems to have gone wrong. When you wake up your bunk mate is gone. You also can't seem to find anyone else. At least anyone that still breaths. </desc>
