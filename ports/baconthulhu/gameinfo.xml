    <desc>At a picnic with friends, Bob the Hamster eats so much bacon that he blacks out. When he wakes up, he finds himself in a mysterious crypt filled with dangerous monsters, ominous cultists, and whispers of the dreaded BACONTHULHU!
If you love bacon and you love mazes, this is the game for you! ... If you HATE bacon but love mazes, this is probably still the game for you.</desc>
