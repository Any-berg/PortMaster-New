### Summary

The western continent of Garden is vast, hiding plenty of secrets to find. You'll be asked to think and interact with the world around you to find hints to helpful boons, treasures, and leads on your quest to stamp out problems happening across the realm.

Throughout the journey, You'll be encountering a wide variety of antagonistic dragons, floral beasts, and even a few haunting spectres. Combat is simple, with a single player against a single enemy at a moment. There are plenty of techniques to learn and equipment to find, to handle the quirky obstacles in your way.
