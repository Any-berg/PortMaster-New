- Steam or GOG data files can be found in `Flashback_Data/StreamingAssets/data`, copy these files into the reminiscence/gamedata folder.
- Amiga audio files (optional) can be copied into the reminiscence/music folder, but the files may need to be renamed from `mod.flashback-filename` to `filename.mod`.
- voice.vce file (optional) for voice acting in cutscenes should be placed in reminiscence/gamedata folder.
