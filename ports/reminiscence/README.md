- Steam or GOG data files can be found in `Flashback_Data/StreamingAssets/data`, copy these files into the `ports/reminiscence/gamedata` folder.
- Amiga audio files (optional) can be copied into the `ports/reminiscence/music` folder, but the files must be named `filename.mod` format. Some sources come with files named `mod.flashback-filename`, which will need to be renamed. e.g. `mod.flashback-chute -> chute.mod`
- voice.vce file (optional) for voice acting in cutscenes should be placed in `ports/reminiscence/gamedata` folder.
