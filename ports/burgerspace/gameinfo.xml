    <desc>Burgertime  is an arcade game where the player is a cook trying to make his 4 hamburgers by stomping on their ingredients (buns, lettuce, ground meat) to knock them down, while avoiding his pursuers - the condiments (eggs, sausage, peppers), who are trying to catch him, but whom he can nonetheless temporarily immobilize with his pepperpot or eliminate by crushing them with one of the ingredients.</desc>
