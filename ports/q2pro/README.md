Place the contents from the folders of your Quake 2 install to the matching folders in ports/q2pro/.  If you have the Nightdive remaster, add the contents of its baseq2/ folder to ports/q2pro/rerelease/, and copy Q2Game.kpf to ports/q2pro/.

Credit and thanks to Andrey Nazarov (Skuller) for Q2Pro.  Many thanks to Slayer366 as well for testing and help with scripts.
