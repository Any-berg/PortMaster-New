    <desc>Once upon a Möbius strip is a short point &amp; click adventure in glorious 1-bit pixel art. It serves as a prequel to Uncle Lee strikes again, but it can be enjoyed as a standalone game as well.

You play as Ines, a 10-year-old girl who would really, REALLY, like to go the bathroom this morning—the universe, however, has other plans.</desc>
