## Notes
Thank you to Axilirate (https://store.steampowered.com/app/1625760/Dave_Dave_Dave/) for allowing us to make this game Ready To Run and to Damien for patching out the Steam dependencies for me!

Please read the controls before playing to know what you're doing while in combat. The use of Auto Hot Keys is used in this game.
