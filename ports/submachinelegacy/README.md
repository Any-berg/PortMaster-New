## Notes

**Text can be hard to read on low resolution handhelds (640 x 480 and lower). Although the game should still be playable without major issues.**

**Special thanks to ...**
* ***Mateusz Skutnik*** - Developer and artist behind **Submachine Legacy**
* *JohnnyOnFlame* - GMLoader-Next allowing to port GameMaker games.
* *Jeod* - I used EmulationStation-ImageMaker for the cover, very useful script. Also helped me to make my first port.
* And of course the *PortMaster community* and *devs* for their support and making this possible in the first place.
