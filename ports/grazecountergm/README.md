## General
 
This port supports Steam version of the game. On devices with the RK3326 processor, there is a noticeable performance drop in some scenes.

## Instructions for Running

- Purchase game via https://store.steampowered.com/app/1486440/Graze_Counter_GM/
- Place all game .dat and .win files in the "/assets/" folder. 
- On first run, the game will take a ~5 minutes to load. The port is running through compressing audio files and packing files into the .apk. Subsequent starts should go faster.
