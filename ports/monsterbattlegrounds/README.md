## Notes

Thank You SO MUCH to Weenter for developing this game and to his Music Developer, DreamWare, for creating this game together and allowing it to be READY TO RUN on PortMaster!!!

Controls:
-You will first choose your stage. You can add hazardss (falling rocks and such) to the game by pressing "Start" on this screen.
While in the Character Select Menu, you will make selections using your "Attack" button (L1/R1). 
-First you Select Character. 
-Then your color which is changed by Left & Right/Y & A. 
-Then you select Control Options, whether the player is a Human, easy bot, or hard bot and whether you want jump deactivated on DPad Up/X by pressing those buttons. (I recommend not messing with this.)
Lastly, finishing up, press "Attack" once more to confirm the battle.(L1 & R1)

If you make a mistake and want to go back to the previous "Character Options", use L2/R2.

Pressing forward towards the enemy Twice, makes you Dash. Down makes you Block, and Attack will create a different move each time, depending on what direction you're pressing at that time. Diagonals included and also, while in the Air. HAVE FUN! Play with Someone else as well!
