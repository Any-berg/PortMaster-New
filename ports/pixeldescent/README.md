## Notes

Thanks to [JC Bailey](https://jc-bailey.itch.io) for creating this great game, which you can purchase at [itch.io](https://jc-bailey.itch.io/pixel-descent)

Port tested using version: `PixelDescent.zip (V1.22)` -- *Oct 10, 2024*

**Note** that the game runs too slow on an RK3326 SoC. The framerate is also slower on H700/RK3566, but the game speed is close enough to play fine.
