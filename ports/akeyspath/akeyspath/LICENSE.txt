Hello Tristan,

Sorry for the late answer but thanks for asking ! I have no issue with it as long as you credit me and give a link to the original game.

I have to ask though, most of these handheld devices only have controller input don't they ? Isn't it going to be hard porting a mouse &keyboard-only game to them ? Anyway good luck, and if you need it the original source code is available here on Github: https://github.com/geegaz/A-Key-s-Path

Hope you have a nice week-end,
Geegaz

Hi Geegaz

My name is Tristan. I'm part of a group of developers working on porting games to handheld Linux devices. Our project is named PortMaster http://portmaster.games

We've added various Godot games to these systems and would love to include A Key(s) Path. Would you permit us to include your .pck file in our packages? Without your consent, users must manually download the files for our ports.

We do not want to profit or take credit for your games. Our primary goal is to introduce more games to our beloved handheld devices.

Thank you for considering our request!
