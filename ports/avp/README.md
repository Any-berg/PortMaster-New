## Notes
This port is for the 1999 PC game ["Aliens versus Predator" ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_Versus_Predator_(1999_video_game)).

The following files are needed:
- avp_huds directory
- avp_rifs directory
- fastfile directory
- language.txt file

Includes 2 saves:
- 100% all missions and all cheats
- default profile with nothing unlocked

Both have the controls setup for each species.
