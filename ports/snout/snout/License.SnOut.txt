Hello Zeritum,
I'm part of a group of developers and testers working on porting games to handheld Linux devices. Our project is named PortMaster (https://portmaster.games/), and we also have an active Discord server.

I am currently working on porting SnOut internally, and it looks and plays really great on handhelds!

It would be fantastic if you could grant us permission to include the build from itch.io/Steam in the package, this way users can download and install it on their device in one click. Without your consent, we would direct users to manually download the game from itch.io and copy it over to their device.

Either way, this game would be a superb addition to these handheld devices. 

Please note, we are not looking to profit or take credit for any of the games. Our primary goal is to introduce more games to our beloved handheld devices.

Thanks for considering our request!

Hello! Just confirming that we are talking about the free game SnOut and not the paid sequel SnOut 2? If it's the free version then go ahead and use it, preferably the Steam version as the Itch one has not been updated in a long time and may not work with the high scores board
