Hello Alan, thank you for making the awesome game Fool's End!
i'm a dev from https://portmaster.games/ and we are a group of devs bringing pc games to retro handheld devices
I’m in the midst of porting fool’s end. For our project we supply sort of a middleware and users need to purchase the game from steam and supply their own game files

I was wondering my if I could include the demo from itch.io as part of the package
Regardless thank you for making this awesome game! And have completed all the levels on my PC already haha

Thanks for sharing. Funny you mention the demo on Itch.io, because i can't remember how up to date it is. 
I have no problem with including the demo. My only hesitation is that I can't remember how comparable the gameplay demo on Itch is to the full game
