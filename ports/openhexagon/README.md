## Installation

### Steam or Itch.io (Paid)
- Purchase the game (on Steam)[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1358090/Open_Hexagon/] or on (Itch.io)[https://vittorioromeo.itch.io/open-hexagon]
- Download the game (Windows or Linux version) and copy the `Assets` and `Packs` folder to the `openhexagon` directory. 
- Do not copy over any other files
### Github (Free)
- Download and extract the game files (from here)[https://github.com/vittorioromeo/SSVOpenHexagonAssets/archive/refs/heads/master.zip]
- (Optional) Delete the `experimental` and `workshopexample` Packs to get parity with the Steam version.
- Copy the `Assets` and `Packs` folder to the `openhexagon` directory.
- Do not copy over any other files

The necessary runtime to run this should be automatically downloaded, but if it isn't, download the `Westonpack 0.2` runtime on the Portmaster App. In case you have previously installed ports that used Westonpack, you might need to uninstall and reinstall the runtime to get the newest version of it, which is required.

This port uses the new Westonpack runtime and libcrusty to provide X11 compatibility on devices that do not support X11. The runtime is still in active development and somewhat experimental. If you are experiencing issues, please reach out to me on the PM discord server, so i can improve this runtime. Thanks!
