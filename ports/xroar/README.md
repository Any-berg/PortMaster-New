## Notes
<br/>
Color computer and Dragon32 emulator XRoar
The compatible rom files need to be included in the ports/xroar/bios folder for example: bas13.rom 

Place color computer game files in the appropriate ports/xroar/roms subfolder.

An open source Snake game is included

Note: if screen looks like screenshot you must add the appropriate system bios files.

Thanks to  
Slayer366 for building an entire front end to allow game and machine selection for the roms
