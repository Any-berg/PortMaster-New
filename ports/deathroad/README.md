Installation:
-Take the Windows/Linux game files from your game folder
-Dump them straight into /ports/deathroad/ folder
-When prompted to overwrite a file, do not overwrite it, skip it instead
-Launch the game via your console

Steam Game files work, but you will get a tiny popup on top, may cause incompatablity with certain mods.
GoG Game files will work without issue.
