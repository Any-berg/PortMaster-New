Eating several things without touching the ground will score you a combo, so try to stay in the air for as long as you can! The timer constantly ticks down; you can eat anything to keep it going a little longer, but watch out for ghosts which are lethal to the touch! You can stop bombs from exploding by eating them before they hit the water.",
