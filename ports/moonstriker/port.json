The player ship can attack with normal shots or with lock-on laser, by moving the target reticle over enemies while the fire button is held. Initially five lasers can lock-on, but this can be increased by collecting power-ups. The game offers a 7-level arcade mode, with 3 difficulty levels, and a 3-minute caravan mode.",
