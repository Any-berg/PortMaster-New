    <desc>In this game, you've lost your sword, and have to make do with the stalactites that fall from the ceiling. Each stalactite is brittle, so it has only one use. After that, it breaks, and you are missing a weapon until another one falls. Developed by FartFish for the Godot Wild Jam 31.</desc>
