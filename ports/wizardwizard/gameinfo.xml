    <desc>WizardWizard is a challenging and addicting platformer with tight controls and simple mechanics. The game play is complimented by beautiful pixel graphics and awesome beats by the talented producer _TWC. WizardWizard is easy to pick up and play making for a fun social experience at school or on at a lunch break. WizardWizard is a game with a lot of love and character that will kick your butt and drive you to tears... I hope anyway.</desc>
