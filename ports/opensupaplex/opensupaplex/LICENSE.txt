As expressed in cilliemalan's repo, the disassembled assembly source code of the game is released under the MIT license.

This repository also includes the resources from the original game, now distributed as freeware, that belong to their original authors.

On the other hand, I release the reimplementation in C under the GPLv3 license.

If you have a problem with this please don't hesitate to contact me.
