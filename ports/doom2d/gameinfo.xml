    <desc>Doom 2D is a fan-made DOS-based freeware side-scrolling video game released by Prikol Software in August 1996. It is based upon Doom, similar to Doom 2D - Knee deep in the dead. Doom 2D is essentially the original Doom translated into a two-dimensional arcade or console-like shooter, comparable to the original Duke Nukem. The player resumes their role as Doomguy, who must do battle with various hell-spawn.</desc>
