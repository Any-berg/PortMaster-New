## Notes

Great big thanks to [VDO Games](https://store.steampowered.com/app/418120/Callys_Caves_3/) for creating this fun game series! 
Special thanks to all who tested this port and to Ganimoth for assisting with the aarch64 build of this port! Thank You All!!!ðŸŽ©

## Performance
    
The in-game screen ratio settings on this game do not work proper and this issue remains one to be worked out. 
That stated, this game is still fully enjoyable on multiple handhelds. Scales and looks great on TSP, X55, RGB20pro screens, as well as others.
