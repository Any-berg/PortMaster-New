    <desc>The plot is set in 13th century. The player takes a role of Jean Raymond â€“ one of clerics who preached about the poverty of Christ and a life without material aspirations, and who were for this reason treated as heretics by the Catholic Church.

Jean is running away from crusaders who want him dead. He finds an old church and decides to hide there. He doesn't know what ancient evils hide in that place. </desc>
