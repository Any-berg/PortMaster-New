    <desc>Passage is a five-minute experimental art game that metaphorically represents an entire human lifetime, allowing players to navigate a pixelated world while exploring themes of love, aging, and mortality.

The game only lasts 5 minutes. If you don't get the point at first, please keep playing.</desc>
