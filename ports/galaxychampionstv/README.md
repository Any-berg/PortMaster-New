# Notes

Thanks to [aQuadin](https://aquadiun.itch.io) for creating this fantastic game, which you can purchase at [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/842750/Galaxy_Champions_TV)

Note that this is for the **Steam** version (**not itch.io**) and runs an older game version (before the Unity conversion).
