    <name>Will You Snail?</name>
    <desc>A unique platformer where an evil AI predicts your movement. Dodge AI-spawned traps, solve optional puzzles and uncover the dark secrets of the simulation.
A lot of levels in Will You Snail are relatively empty by default. The challenge comes from the interactions with the evil AI. You will jump, run, dodge and die. This game is precise, fast-paced and challenging. (Stay cool, you can change the difficulty at any time.)</desc>
