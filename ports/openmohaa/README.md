## Port details
This is an arm64 build of the unmodified [source code](https://github.com/openmoh/openmohaa/). Graphics settings have been reduced for good performance on low-spec devices, but can be increased using the in-game options.

See [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/PortsMaster/PortMaster-New/blob/main/ports/openmohaa/openmohaa/BUILDING.md) for building instructions.
