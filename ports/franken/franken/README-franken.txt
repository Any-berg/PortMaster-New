FRANKEN - by samanthuel louise gillson (splendidland)

welcome to my new game.... FRANKEN RPG!

in this game you control a hero who fights monsters to save the world.
at the start of the game you can name the hero.

CONTROLS:
arrow keys - walk around, control menus
spacebar/enter/ctrl - use, talk to NPCs, confirm
esc/alt - open and close the main menu

BATTLES:
you press the use key to attack. and that's pretty much it.
when you defeat an enemy, you'll level up and gain more hearts.
look for sword upgrades to increase your strength!
if you die, you'll appear at the last save crystal you used.

MAC VERSION INFO:
if the mac version doesn't work here's some Cool Instructions you can try
 1. Open up Terminal
 2. Type in "sudo chmod -R +x " [without quotes] and then drag in franken.app to add the path to the file. Then append "/Contents/MacOS" to the end of the directory [without quotes] and hit enter
 3. Enter your password when prompted. this command will tell the OS that the directory given contains a file that should be allowed to be executable
 4. right click franken.app and click open
