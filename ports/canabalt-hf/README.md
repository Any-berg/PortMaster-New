### Acknowledgements

Thanks to Adam Saltsman and Danny Baranowsky for the original game, and Cameron Taylor for the [HaxeFlixel port](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/canabalt-hf).

Thanks to ptitSeb for [gl4es](https://github.com/ptitSeb/gl4es) and to BinaryCounter for [Westonpack](https://github.com/binarycounter/Westonpack/wiki), without both of which this port would not be possible.

### Port info

The source code is slightly modified to remove Newgrounds integration. Two versions of the game are provided, one for 1080p devices and one for lower resolutions.

The port is an arm64 build of the HaxeFlixel (OpenFl/lime) code, and uses gl4es and WestonPack to provide libraries that are missing on most CFWs.

See [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/PortsMaster/PortMaster-New/blob/main/ports/canabalt-hf/canabalt-hf/BUILDING.md) for building instructions.
