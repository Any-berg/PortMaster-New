# Notes

Thanks to Team D-13 for creating this game, titled [Monolith](https://team-d-13.itch.io/monolith) on itch.io, and [Star of Providence](https://store.steampowered.com/app/603960/Star_of_Providence) on Steam.

This has been tested with the Monolith.exe full version (Jan 13, 2019) from itch.io. It supports an older Steam version, retrievable via download_depot/DepotDownloader.

**ROCKNIX Users:** Use the Steam version. You may need to realign the reticle with the mouse cursor -- move the mouse cursor to the top left corner to do this.
