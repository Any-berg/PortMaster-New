## Notes
Must have been the wind (https://untamed-arcade.itch.io/must-have-been-the-wind)

**Thanks for [Untamed Arcade](https://untamed-arcade.itch.io/) for developing this lovely game!**

A survival game, but you're the environment

Does it feel like the world is against you? Not today!
Today you're the world, and you're  against an unsuspecting player.

Puzzle yourself through nature-filled islands to become the ultimate survival environment - as harsh as possible!

Made in 48 hours for the GMTK-Jam 2023


**Mechanic explanation (if you're confused):**
The sound from different events (trees falling, fire spreading) alerts the player to run away
if it's on the same grid line horizontally or vertically, whether there's an obstacle in the way or not.
Another way to imagine it is a + shape.
