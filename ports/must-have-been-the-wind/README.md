## Notes
Must have been the wind (https://untamed-arcade.itch.io/must-have-been-the-wind)

**Thanks for [Untamed Arcade](https://untamed-arcade.itch.io/) for developing this lovely game!**

**Mechanic explanation (if you're confused):**
The sound from different events (trees falling, fire spreading) alerts the player to run away
if it's on the same grid line horizontally or vertically, whether there's an obstacle in the way or not.
Another way to imagine it is a + shape.
